We aimed to create a proof of concept app that helps match job seekers with jobs in the developing world.

Day labourers typically find work intermittently, and unreliably. While jobs requiring manual labour can appear and disappear incredibly quickly.
Given that mobile phone (but not smartphone) penetration is very high in countries like India, a text based service could provide a lot of value.

We created an app that allows a job seekers to text a central servivce, indicating that he/she is looking for work, and allows employers to text the service, indicating workers needed.
